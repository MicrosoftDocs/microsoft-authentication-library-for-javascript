summary: >-
  Extensibility interface, which allows the app developer to return a token,
  based on the passed-in parameters, instead of fetching tokens from

  the Identity Provider (AAD).

  Developers need to construct and return an AppTokenProviderResult object back
  to MSAL. MSAL will cache the token response

  in the same way it would do if the result were comming from AAD.

  This extensibility point is only defined for the client_credential flow, i.e.
  acquireTokenByClientCredential and

  meant for Azure SDK to enhance Managed Identity support.
