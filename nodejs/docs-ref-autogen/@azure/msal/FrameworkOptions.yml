  App/Framework specific environment support

  - isAngular                - flag set to determine if it is Angular Framework.
  MSAL uses this to broadcast tokens. More to come here: detangle this
  dependency from core.

  - unprotectedResources     - Array of URI's which are unprotected resources.
  MSAL will not attach a token to outgoing requests that have these URI.
  Defaults to 'null'.

  - protectedResourceMap     - This is mapping of resources to scopes used by
  MSAL for automatically attaching access tokens in web API calls.A single
  access token is obtained for the resource. So you can map a specific resource
  path as follows: {"https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me", ["user.read"]}, or
  the app URL of the resource as: {"https://graph.microsoft.com/", ["user.read",
  "mail.send"]}. This is required for CORS calls.
